Both URI and UVa online judges have wrong packages for problem i.
To run official on site testes copy your solution to the folder
"Checker I" with name "i.cpp" and run on terminal 

$bash checker.sh

If the checker only display running times and no diffs the solution 
is correct. Notice that the oficial time limit is 3 seconds and 
memory limit is 1gb.
